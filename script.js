//Step 1: create timer that is set to two minutes.  
//The timer will be made using the set timer function, and will be designed to decrease the time by 10 seconds for each wrong answer.
//Step 2: Create 10 variable arrays, each with four answers in the array. The questions will be delivered through a prompt. 
    //If the correct answer is given, there will be an alert that says "correct!".  
    //If the answer is incorrect, there will be an alert that says "incorrect!" and 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer.
//Step 3: The progrram should be keeping track of which answers were answered correctly or incorrectly. 
    //When the timer stops, the player should get a score detailing how many questions they got right and how many they got wrong.
        //These scores should be stored in the scores category, in last ranging in order from highest to lowest.
        //The player should get a prompt asking for their name once they get their score.
        //The player should be able to play again with a reset button.
